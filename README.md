# Change Data Capture using SSIS

This project is about developing an ETL Pipeline using SSIS, to capture the changes such as insert,update & delete made on the on-premise source file. The appropriate changes are then captured on the destination table residing in SQL Server with appropriate date and times. The project's implementation depicts the raw coded version of change data capture rather than enabling CDC on the destination table.   

Please find some of the snapshots of the developed ETL package and the final result.
